                The whistle blows and the game starts. The ball is crossed over to <strong>Bryan Mbumbo</strong>. He shoots — he scores!<br>
                But wait, why is nobody celebrating? Bryan looks back and realizes that Virgil and Mac Alister collided. Everyone is wondering if the goal counts: the home side is screaming for it to be canceled, the away stand is screaming for it to count. Finally, the referee makes the decision — <strong>Goooooaaaaal!</strong> The away stand erupts in celebration while the home side is speechless.<br>
                In the dying moments of the game, Mo Salah crosses it to Gakpo, who scores. Manchester United fans are worried, Liverpool fans are cheering.<br>
                Just when everyone thinks the game will end in a draw, Harry Maguire heads it in — 2-1! Manchester United wins. Fans scream <strong>Goooooaaaaal!</strong> It’s like nothing they’ve seen before.<br>
                As the final whistle blows, Manchester United fans and players celebrate their hearts out. That’s the story of the game.
